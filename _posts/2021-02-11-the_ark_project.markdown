I'm super passionate about the stock market and learning more about how I can invest. It’s fascinating to me that I can invest my money into companies that change the world.  Ark Invest is an asset management company; its investment strategy focuses on innovation and disruption. Daily, they release an excel file that lists their intraday trading (All stocks bought and sold that day). The app that I made, ArkTracker, is able to read an excel file, pull info from the file to list the stocks that were sold and bought, and it uses a stock API (TwelveData) to return the current stock price of Ark Innovation ETF ($ARKK) as well as Elon’s favorite stock Tesla $TSLA. I hope you enjoy!
